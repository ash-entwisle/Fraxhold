### City History:
The history of the city is closely tied to the history of it's ruling family, the Korkwalds. A Dragonborn clan who rule with their maternal line with the help of a Demonic contract. The city has done away with Idolatry and instead follows the Patron and the Patrician. The city's origins date back ~450 years ago, with the `name pending` between the Patron of the city, the Demon Barron, and the Patrician Zumulong Korkwald. A Bargain was struck that in exchange for the souls of both him and his family line the city would gain protections against criminals and a production of bountiful harvests each year, until either one of their descendants failed to comply with the contract, or the demon in question failed their charge. Since then the city has experienced unprecedented growth and prosperity, despite it's inhospitable locale. It is the only settlement within miles to be able to consistently grow crops year-round and supplies many outlying villages with much needed grain and cotton.

### Nobles:
##### The Korkwalds
- Ancestral Home: Dimgarde Monastery (expanded to hold town meetings and general business)
- Family History: The first Patrician of Dimgarde, one Zumulong Korkwald saw that their usual methods of avoiding famine and civil unrest (Prayer and devotion to their god) had never gotten them anywhere, and summarily decided Deities were wholly unreliable. This led them to the only logical conclusion; commissioning a first-rate Demonic Patron. ~450 years have passed since then and the maternal line of the Korkwalds has held strong, bringing prosperity and opportunities to their small hamlet, which has since grown into the sprawling City of Dimgarde. They are the de facto ruling family of the city, and have ties with all other noble Dragonborn houses.
