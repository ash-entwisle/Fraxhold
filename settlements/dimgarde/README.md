### City History:
The history of the city is closely tied to the history of it's ruling family, the Korkwalds. A Dragonborn clan who rule with their maternal line with the help of a Demonic contract. The city has done away with Idolatry and instead follows the Patron and the Patrician. The city's origins date back ~450 years ago, with the [^2] between the Patron of the city, the Demon Barron, and the Patrician Zumulong Korkwald. A Bargain was struck that in exchange for the souls of both him and his family line the city would gain protections against criminals and a production of bountiful harvests each year, until either one of their descendants failed to comply with the contract, or the demon in question failed their charge. Since then the city has experienced unprecedented growth and prosperity, despite it's inhospitable locale. It is the only settlement within miles to be able to consistently grow crops year-round and supplies many outlying villages with much needed grain and cotton. A common saying refers to their distain for organised religions, "Your Gods are fickle, ours is under Contract".

### Political Climate:
Dimgarde is an Independent city, irrespective of the forces surrounding it. As Dimgarde is a font of wealth and resources in the area, no political force has been able to lay claim to the area without being pushed back by one of the other major powers. Therefore, Dimgarde is considered neutral territory for diplomats and other negotiations. As the city is not part of any larger faction, it has no standing army, and relies on the protection of all of it's nearby allies in case of raiders or a potential invasion (which hasn't occurred in over 300 years). 

The closest faction is the Giantkin, the mountain-dwelling race which have been in close contact with Dimgarde since before the [^2]. Compared to their Orcish counterparts, Giantkin have advanced beyond their primal instincts somewhat, due to their continual contact with the original dragonborn populace. Some lowlanders, willing to brave the cold and harsh peaks have made their way to the city, leading to a sizable human and elf populace in the outer city.

### Nobles:
##### The Korkwalds
- Ancestral Home: Dimgarde Monastery (expanded to hold town meetings and general business)
- Family History: The first Patrician of Dimgarde, one Zumulong Korkwald saw that their usual methods of avoiding famine and civil unrest (Prayer and devotion to their god) had never gotten them anywhere, and summarily decided Deities were wholly unreliable. This led them to the only logical conclusion; commissioning a first-rate Demonic Patron. ~450 years have passed since then and the maternal line of the Korkwalds has held strong, bringing prosperity and opportunities to their small hamlet, which has since grown into the sprawling City of Dimgarde. They are the de facto ruling family of the city, and have marital and trade ties with all other noble Dragonborn houses.
