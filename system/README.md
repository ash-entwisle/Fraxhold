## Combat

### Initiative order

Initiative is based off of Roleplay and a call/response from enemies and players. Depending on who initiated the combat determines which team goes first. 

Initiative order is determined by RP, whoever takes the initiative gets the initiative. If players want to go next, they can signal the dm to be "on deck", the DM should note this down and take that players initiative next. 

Let players discuss what they want to do and to lead the combat if possible. If a player is taking a while, spice it up by dropping an enemies turn in while you wait for that player to figure their turn out. 

At the end of each turn, the dm should describe the lay of the land, whos left standing and whos "bloodied"

The target must move 5ft in a direction of your choice away from the attacker. This action triggers opportunity attacks and can not be taken multiple times in a turn. 





### Attack Actions

### Roll

Roll the damage dice for the weapon, cantrip or spell, if the attack has no dice, it hits automatically. You hit on anything but a 1 and critical hit on a max roll. (e.g. rolling a d6 to attack, you would miss on a 1 and crit on a 6). 
### Damage

When calculating damage, you take your attack roll, roll the rest of your damage dice and add any modifiers. This is how much damage you dealt
#### Critical Hits

On a critical hit, you double the amount of dice you roll and re-roll all 1's
#### For the DM

Roll or fudge when calculating damage for players. When calculating the damage enemies take, round to the nearest 10, divide by 10 and take that away from the enemies hit allocation.
