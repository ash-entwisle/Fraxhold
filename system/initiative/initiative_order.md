# Initiative order

Initiative is based off of Roleplay and a call/response from enemies and players. Depending on who initiated the combat determines which team goes first. 

Initiative order is determined by RP, whoever takes the first initiative gets the first turn. Play then continues Clockwise round the table (or in name descending order if you are using online chat)

At the start of a players turn, the [DM](DM.md) will signal to the next player to be on deck. That player can then carry out all their actions.

If the current player isnt ready, the next player takes their turn. Once you've gone round the table once, you then go back to the people who were previously not ready. 

Enemies get their turns during initiative and can be used as a mechanism for punishing players who take too long on their turn.
