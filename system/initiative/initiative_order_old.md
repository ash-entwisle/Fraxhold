# Initiative order

Initiative is based off of Roleplay and a call/response from enemies and players. Depending on who initiated the combat determines which team goes first. 

Initiative order is determined by RP, whoever takes the first initiative gets the first turn. If players want to go next, they can signal the dm to be "on deck", the DM should note this down and take that players initiative next. 

Let players discuss what [actions](actions.md) they want to take. let them lead the combat if possible making sure each person gets one turn each initiative. If a player is taking a while, spice it up by dropping an enemies turn in while you wait for that player to figure their turn out. 

At the end of each turn, the [DM](DM.md) should describe the lay of the land, who's left standing and who's [bloodied](bloodied.md) 

I usually run it in the following stages:
1. Any Important/Key Characters / enemies if they are ambushed or players are taking a while. If the players ambush the enemy, all enemies for the first turn go last
2. the first half of the players
3. the rest of the enemies
4. the rest of the players
