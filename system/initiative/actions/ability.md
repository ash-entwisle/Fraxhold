# Ability

> Cost: 1 action


Make an ability score check. Explain to the DM why you want to do it and what the expected outcome is. You then roll the dice and add your ability modifier. 

The [DM](DM.md) will then set a [Difficulty Class](DC.md). They don't have to tell you what it is, you just have to roll more. The [DM](DM.md) may also say you can roll it with [advantage](advantage.md) or [disadvantage](disadvantage.md)

You can find the full list of abilities and skills along with examples of when they may be used here:
