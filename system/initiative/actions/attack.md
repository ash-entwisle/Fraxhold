# Attack

> Cost: 1 Action

You can make one attack (or cast a cantrip) with a weapon you are currently holding. If you are dual-weilding, you can only make one attack, but you get to choose which weapon. If you get multi-attack, you are not limited by second-attack penalty but you can only multi-attack on your first attack action.

A second attack comes at the penalty of being capped at one dice + modifier

A Third attack comes at the penalty of being capped at one dice

## Selecting A Weapon

When a character or creature wants to make an attack, they first have to select a weapon. This could be anything from a scimitar, to a spell 

## Rolling to Attack

Next, roll one of the dice used to roll damage for the attack. If it is a 1, you miss. If it is a max roll, you [crit](#crits). Anything else hits. 

Depending on the situation, the [DM](DM.md) can ask you to roll this with [advantage](advantage.md) or [disadvantage](disadvantage.md)

## Calculating Damage

Roll the rest of the weapons damage dice, add any modifiers from abilities and tally up the total (including the roll to attack). This is how much damage you have done to the monster. 

### Crits

> NOTE: the DM may use a different system for crit damage calculation such as double rolls, double damage, rr1's e.c.t. Always check with your DM for house rules

We recommend Exploding Dice to calculate crit damage. You do this by rolling an extra damage dice for your attack (the same one you used when rolling for attack) and adding this to the total. 

If the number rolled is max you can roll an additional die, this continues until you get anything but the max. If the number rolled is 1, you can [re-roll it](rr1.md). If the number is neither 1, nor max, tally up all the dice rolls and modifiers.
