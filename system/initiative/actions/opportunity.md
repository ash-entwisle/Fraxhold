# Opportunity Attacks

> Cost: 1 action

If a creature within [combat range](combat_range.md) of you moves away you can roll to [attack](attack.md), but you are limited at one dice + modifier. Opportunity attacks are taken at [disadvantage](disadvantage.md) and don't trigger the multi attack penalty. This action can be taken out of turn order. This action can not be taken multiple times in a turn.
