# Grapple

> Cost: 1 action

You grapple a creature within 5ft of you. If the target is not willing, you both make a [athletics](athletics.md) check, whoever is higher succeeds. If the target fails, their speed becomes zero. You can move with the target, the target doesn't expend any movement. If the target is unwilling, all move actions that they try to undertake while grappled are halved. You can not take this action multiple times in a turn. 

[Critical Failing](DC.md) a grapple can provoke an [opportunity attack](opportunity.md) from the target
